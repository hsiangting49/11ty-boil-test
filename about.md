# About the universe 
# **We are now located in the Solar System**
## The universe is an immensely vast and complex expanse that encompasses everything that existsâ€”space, time, matter, and energy. It includes galaxies, stars, planets, cosmic dust, dark matter, and dark energy. Observations and studies indicate that the universe is expanding, with galaxies moving away from each other.
